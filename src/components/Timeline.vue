                            I started looking into HTML and CSS because I wanted to create a website for a project
                            I worked on with a friend. This worked out, though that website was quite crappy (as expected).
                            It even used HTML frames üòÖ. But all beginnings are difficult.

                            After getting in touch with basic HTML and CSS a few months before, I started learning
                            Java. The motivation was quite simple: There was an insane hype around "Minecraft", and
                            the plugins were written in Java. Because I wanted to learn programming in general, I
                            thought starting with Java shouldn't be a bad decision.
                            My goal was to learn Java in general, not only for Minecraft.

                            ... I wanted to learn more and more. While developing stuff from simple tools to GUI based
                            applications with JSON processing, I also looked into databases (MySQL) and PHP.

                            The concept of dynamic websites fascinated me a lot.

                            In the 9th grade, we must fulfill a work experience at a company of our choice. Of course,
                            we must apply for that internship regularly. My first thought was a computer repair company
                            to gain knowledge about the hardware, but then I applied at a smaller software company in
                            my town and they accepted my application!

                            My first task was testing their current system and trying to break it. After reporting the
                            found bugs and caveats they saw that my understanding was quite good for a 15 year old guy,
                            so the follow-up tasks were more complex and deep, like creating configs and setting up
                            the database.
