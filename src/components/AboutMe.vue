                I'm <span class="text-grey-darkest">Alex</span>, a guy in his twenties living in
                <span class="text-grey-darkest">Dresden, Germany</span>. Already at young age, computers impressed me
                so much that I wanted to know more about them. Now, I'm a self-taught developer who runs his
                <span class="text-grey-darkest">own company</span> and studies CS in the meantime.
                <br><br>
                When developing web apps, I mostly rely on the <span class="text-grey-darkest">Laravel</span>
                framework for the backend.
                In terms of frontend, <span class="text-grey-darkest">Vue.js</span> is my favorite choice,
                often together with two great CSS frameworks: The well-known
                <span class="text-grey-darkest">Bootstrap</span> or the newly released
                <span class="text-grey-darkest">TailwindCSS</span>
                <br><br>
                Can't see parts of your tech-stack on that list? <span class="text-grey-darkest">Don't worry!</span>
                Depending on the projects aim and requirements, I use way more technologies than listed above.
