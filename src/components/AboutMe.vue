                I'm <span class="text-grey-darkest">Alex</span>, a 20-year-old guy living in
                <span class="text-grey-darkest">Dresden, Germany</span>. Already at young age, I was impressed of
                computers and wanted to know more about them. Now, I'm a self-taught developer running his
                <span class="text-grey-darkest">own company</span> and studying CS in the meantime.
                <br><br>
                When developing web apps, I rely on the <span class="text-grey-darkest">Laravel</span>
                framework for the backend most of time.
                As javascript frontend frameworks I choose <span class="text-grey-darkest">Vue.js</span>, while I
                use <span class="text-grey-darkest">Bootstrap</span> or the newly released
                <span class="text-grey-darkest">Tailwind</span> in terms of CSS frameworks.
                <br><br>
                But of course I used a bunch of other technologies, depending on the projects aim and requirements!
