                    I'm <span class="text-grey-darkest">Alex</span>, a 20-year-old guy living in
                    <span class="text-grey-darkest">Dresden, Germany</span>. Already at young age, I was impressed of
                    computers and wanted to know more about them. Now, I'm a self-taught developer running his 
                    <span class="text-grey-darkest">own company</span> and studying CS in the meantime.
                    <br><br>
                    When developing web apps, I rely on the <span class="text-grey-darkest">Laravel</span>
                    framework for the backend most of time.
                    As javascript frontend frameworks I choose <span class="text-grey-darkest">Vue.js</span>, while I 
                    use <span class="text-grey-darkest">Bootstrap</span> or the newly released
                    <span class="text-grey-darkest">Tailwind</span> in terms of CSS frameworks.
                    <br><br>
                    But of course I used a bunch of other technologies, depending on the projects aim and requirements!
