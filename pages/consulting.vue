          <h2>Consulting Services</h2>
          <p>Every company is different and their needs vary. That's why I offer a wide range of consulting
            services, including but not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Architecture and Conception</li>
            <li>Code Reviews and Audits</li>
            <li>Improving Performance</li>
            <li>Ensuring your applications meet the best practices</li>
            <li>Solving existing problems of your application</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Process</h2>

          <p>
            The process is simple: You
            <AppMeetingButtonWrapper meeting="intro-website">
              <button
                class="text-red-400 underline decoration-red-400/30 hover:decoration-red-400 transition-all font-bold">reach
                out to me</button>
            </AppMeetingButtonWrapper> and we discuss your needs.
            After that, I'll send you a proposal based on what we agreed upon in the call and we'll
            get started.
          </p>

          <p>
            As mentioned before, the collaboration can range from one-off consulting sessions to long-term project
            guidance.
            Everything from reviewing PRs regularly, and firefighting issues, to discussing the right architecture and
            abstractions is possible.

            <p>
              I onboarded Alex to a legacy project that should be transformed into a modern web application.
              Within a short time, he was able to understand the domain and asked helpful questions regarding the current
              architecture. Eventually, we developed a roadmap for the project and Alex guided us when implementing the
              first features.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              This clearly proved to me that <span class="font-bold">Alex is a highly proficient Web Engineering
                Consultant</span>
              with deep knowledge of Vue.js and Nuxt.js.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              To sum it up: His clear communication, dedication, deep technical understanding,
              and teamwork capabilities make him invaluable to any web development project.
              I am looking forward to collaborating with Alex again in the future.

              When we found ourselves in a bind, Alex stepped in as our problem solver for our Nuxt 2 project.

              since.
