Vue.js is a popular, modern JavaScript framework for developing interactive web applications. With its third major version, Vue 3, it has become even more powerful and easier to use.
During this workshop, we will cover the basics of Vue 3 and learn how to develop web applications using the framework. In fact, we will build one coherent application from scratch, step by step, and learn the most important concepts of Vue 3 along the way.

## Target audience and requirements

This workshop is aimed for developers who have basic [JavaScript](/workshops/javascript-beginner/), HTML and CSS knowledge. There is no Vue knowledge necessary. Having worked with [TypeScript](/workshops/typescript-beginner/) before is a plus, but not required.

## Takeways

After this workshop, you will be able to:

* Create Vue applications from scratch
* Understand the core concepts of Vue.js 3
* Use the Composition API to build own composables
* Utilize Vue Router to create applications with multiple pages
* Manage global state with Pinia

## Format

This workshop is a **hands-on workshop**.

Instead of the typical workshop flow, you will work through the exercises before I'll teach you the theory and background. This way, you will learn the most important concepts of Nuxt.js by doing and not by listening or copying lines of code from the slides.

After each exercise, we will go through the solution and theory together, reinforcing what you have learned.
