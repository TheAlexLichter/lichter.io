## Target audience and requirements

This workshop targets developers who have no or little knowledge of JavaScript and want to learn the basics. No previous knowledge is required. General programming understanding is helpful, but not required.

If JavaScript knowledge is already present but it lacks the info about the latest features, the [Modern JavaScript Workshop](/workshops/javascript-modern/) is recommended. Otherwise, combining is also possible

## Format

This workshop is a **hands-on workshop**.

Instead of the typical workshop flow, you will work through the exercises before I'll teach you the theory and background. This way, you will learn the most important concepts of Nuxt.js by doing and not by listening or copying lines of code from the slides.

After each exercise, we will go through the solution and theory together, reinforcing what you have learned.
