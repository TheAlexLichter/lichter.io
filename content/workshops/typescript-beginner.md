## Target audience and requirements

This workshop is aimed at developers who want to learn TypeScript from scratch. Basic [JavaScript knowledge](/workshops/javascript-modern/) is required, besides that no previous knowledge is necessary.
The workshop will be taught without focusing on a specific framework or library, but rather on the language itself.
As usual, combining workshops is possible and recommended, in case it is planned to e.g. learn [Vue.js](/workshops/vue-beginner/) and TypeScript together.

## Format

This workshop is a **hands-on workshop**.

Instead of the typical workshop flow, you will work through the exercises before I'll teach you the theory and background. This way, you will learn the most important concepts of Nuxt.js by doing and not by listening or copying lines of code from the slides.

After each exercise, we will go through the solution and theory together, reinforcing what you have learned.
