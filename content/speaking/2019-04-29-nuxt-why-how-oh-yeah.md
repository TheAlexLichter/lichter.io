Nuxt.js - You probably have heard the name of the Vue.js framework a few times by now.
Maybe when a colleague of yours gave it a try, or when you saw it on the GitHub report as the fourth fastest growing open source project in 2018....

But of course, you as a smart developer are skeptical:
Why would I need another framework that even sits on top of *another* one?
What is this trendy "SSR" buzzword?
Which problems would Nuxt solve for me and how can I get started?
During the talk I'll answer all of these questions and many more.
Join the meetup for an introduction to Nuxt.js. There is no further knowledge besides basic Vue experience needed.
