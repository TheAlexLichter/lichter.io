Meta-frameworks have developed rapidly in recent years - and so did Nuxt with its latest major version Nuxt 3! But also in the seven minor releases after the big major launch, feature development didn't stop! Wonder what the fuzz is about? Let's have a look!

We will build a small application with Nuxt, check out Nitro, the new server engine of the meta framework, and eventually deploy our small app within minutes.

The best thing? Only basic knowledge of Vue and the Composition API is needed. Swing by and see why Nuxt is an amazing fit for your next project!
