Another spontaneous session on an interesting topic: Search Engine Optimization. Often seen as rocket science or witchcraft, SEO is an important part of many businesses and invested work will be often rewarded in the medium and long term. With a few basics, you can already improve your search engine visibility and get ahead of competitors that don't care about Search Engine Optimization. During the session, I showed a few achievements regarding organic traffic, basic steps every web dev can perform to improve their site visibility and proven
patterns in SEO.
