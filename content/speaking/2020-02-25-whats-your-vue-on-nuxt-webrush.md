In my very first appearance of the Web Rush podcast (back then still RealtalkJS) I joined John Papa, Ward Bell and Dan Wahlin to talk about Nuxt.js, how it fits in the Vue ecosystem and how the Nuxt and Vue team work together. We also talked about live Nuxt (2 back then) examples, what you have to consider when using Nuxt and how to get started with it.
In addition I shared some insights on the complexity of Server Side Rendering and how Nuxt helps you reducing it.
