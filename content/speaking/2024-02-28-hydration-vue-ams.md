Server-side rendering in Vue has lots of benefits. Especially with frameworks like Nuxt.js, developing SSR Vue applications is a breeze, no matter if you use dynamic SSR or static site generation. But on the other hand, server-side rendering also comes with a fair increase of complexity and errors you might have not seen before. While most of them are documented and workarounds are available, one error still boggles lots of minds: When Vue hydration fails.

In this talk, we will have a deeper look into Vue's hydration process and explore together why it is needed in the first place, what it actually does and how it can "fail".
Next, various scenarios of failing hydration are showcased, together with how to debug these scenarios properly.

After this talk, you will have a deep understanding of the hydration process and possible errors will be easy to debug for you.
