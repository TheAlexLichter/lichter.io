After my [first appearance on the Web Rush podcast in 2020](/speaking/2020-02-25-whats-your-vue-on-nuxt-webrush/), I came on the show once again - this time to talk about Nuxt 3 and the future of Nuxt.js.

After describing how Nuxt helps developers in general, we shifted to the general Server Side Rendering topic and how it is different from the "good old PHP times back then".

Eventually we talked about the new features of Nuxt 3, including the experimental server components feature, the devtools and what I'm most excited about with regards to the future of Nuxt.js.
