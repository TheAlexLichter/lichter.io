JavaScript is a language that is constantly evolving. Every year it gets new features and syntax updates. But with so many new features, it's easy to lose track.

In this talk we'll look at which of the newer JavaScript features are helpful for your actual (daily) development and how to use them in different situations. Besides popular features, like Optional Chaining or Array Destructuring, we will also have a look at underrated additions to JavaScript that will still be beneficial for development.

Eventually we will get into the process of how the language evolves, how proposals come up and how they'll be part of the language eventually.
