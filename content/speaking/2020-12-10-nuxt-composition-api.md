Vue 3 and the Composition API are out for a bit now. And while the ecosystem is catching up, more and more libraries provide support for the Composition API through composables. But what is about Server-Side Rendering with the composition API, especially when using Nuxt.js? I got you covered!

In this talk, you will learn about the `@nuxtjs/composition-api` package that provides you a couple of nifty composables as well as SSR support in conjunction with the Composition API itself. Together we look into the new additions of the packages as well as several use cases and examples of how to use the Composition API with Nuxt.js.
