Since Vue existed, people have used it for dozens of different kinds of applications.
While Vue is powering the entire frontend most of the time, there are also situations where (re-)building the frontend with Vue simply doesn't work out. On the one hand, time and budget are scarce, on the other hand, web apps need interactive components and modern solutions to avoid technical dept.

The solution is progressive enhancement: Adding just a few small pieces of JavaScript where absolutely needed. And that's where petite-vue - another distribution of Vue - shines!

Let's take a look together what petite-vue is doing and how it is specialized for progressive enhancement in this talk.
