I thought a lot about what I was going to present at VueCamp. Finally, I decided on something that fits well with
the spirit of a barcamp: Talking with the people, not only to the people. And nothing fits better than an AMA here!
So, I'm curious about your exciting questions regarding the Nuxt ecosystem, the core and (almost) everything else
you want me to tell you.
