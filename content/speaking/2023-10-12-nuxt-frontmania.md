You see innovation and experiments throughout the whole web dev landscape - and you might ask yourself, what happened in the Vue ecosystem regarding meta frameworks recently?

In this talk, we will take a closer look at Nuxt.js, the vue-based meta-framework and find out what the differences are to using plain Vue and also take a look how what makes Nuxt special compared to other meta-frameworks.

Besides building a tiny application, we will also check out Nitro, the new server engine of Nuxt, and eventually deploy our small app within minutes.

The best thing? Only basic knowledge of Vue and the Composition API is needed. Swing by and see why Nuxt is an amazing fit for your next project!
