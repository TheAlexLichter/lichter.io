In this episode of the PodRocket podcast, I had the pleasure to talk with LogRocket about Nuxt and Open Source, answering questions about how I joined the Core Team, what is needed to become a Nuxt contributor and how to get started with Nuxt.

After introducing myself, we talked about how I got into Nuxt and how I became a Nuxt contributor and team member. Briefly summarizing how I joined the core team, we talked about the passion and motivation that drives me to contribute to Nuxt and Open Source in general.

Eventually, we moved on to the question of what Nuxt as a meta framework does and how it compares to other frameworks. Then, the different rendering modes and understanding of them were thematized, including the difference between server-side rendering and static site generation.
