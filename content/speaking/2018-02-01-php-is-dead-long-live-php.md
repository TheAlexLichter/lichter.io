PHP - These three letters don't make many people think of anything good.
But why are so many people averse to this server-side language?
And how can it be that PHP's market share is at an incredible 81 percent, despite all the aversion?
Under the headline "PHP is dead - Long live PHP" and in a funny mood we will explore the topic.

Together with Alexander Lichter we will see how important PHP will be in 2018, it's usefulness when programming applications and what the future looks like for PHP!
Whether you are a real PHP-hater or a new programmer, this talk will give you some interesting information. And the more people there are, the more fun it'll be.
