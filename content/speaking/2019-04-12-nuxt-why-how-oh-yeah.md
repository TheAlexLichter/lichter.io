Nuxt.js - You probably have heard the name of the Vue.js framework at least once. Maybe when a fellow colleague gave it a try, or when you saw it on the GitHub report as 4th fastest growing open source project in 2018. But as a smart developer, you're skeptical...

Why would I need another framework that even sits on top of *another* one? What is this SSR everyone is talking about? What problems would Nuxt solve for me and how to get started? During my talk, all these questions (and many more) will be answered. Join an introduction to Nuxt.js and experience it with no previous knowledge needed besides Vue.
