I joined the Software Engineering Daily podcast for an episode and had the pleasure to talk about how I started programming at all, how I got into web dev and eventually into Vue and Nuxt.js. Also, we discussed whether Nuxt is enterprise-ready or not, which popular websites are built with Nuxt and how Nuxt compares to other frameworks.

In addition, we talked about a possible "data layer" and how data fetching is solved in Nuxt, then focussing on whether Vue knowledge is necessary to learn Nuxt or not. Eventually, we talked about state management,  SEO, Jamstack and common patterns and best practices.

Last but not least, we peaked into the Nuxt 3 beta and the composition API, as well as running it on the edge and serverless.
