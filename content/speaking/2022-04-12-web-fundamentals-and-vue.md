The goal of the workshop was to teach people the fundamentals of the web: How the web works, the basics of the three main languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how to use them together.

Eventually, we took a look at Vue.js as a JavaScript framework and the concepts of single file components, props, events and more!

We also discussed the benefits of using Vue.js and how it can be used to build a better web application.
