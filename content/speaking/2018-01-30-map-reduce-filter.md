The popularity of functional programming is without doubt, even in non-functional languages.
It's rise is underpinned by Java, which now also includes functional paradigms in the language's core.
This talk is perfect for people who never used map, reduce or filter, or for those who don't know a bit about the mentioned functions.

I'll give an introduction about a world that works without for-each loops, lives from expressive code and turns some of the common views topsy-turvy.
Live coding included! No matter if you are new to programming or an OOP-genius, everyone will have something to take away after the talks ;)
