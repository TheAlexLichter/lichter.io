I had the pleasure to join the Enjoy the Vue panel, and was thrilled to share my perspective on Nuxt.js, a Vue framework that offers an intuitive and efficient approach to web development, in this episode.

We'll start by exploring my tech journey and my role as a Nuxt maintainer. Next, there will be a deep dive into Nuxt's key features and my preferred tech stack. I'll also provide tips on using Tailwind CSS effectively and touch on SEO's importance and its connection to user experience.

In the second part of the episode, we'll go deeper into why Nuxt is fantastic for SEO. I'll clarify static and dynamic site rendering and discuss how I use blogs and speaking engagements to support the Nuxt community. I'll also answer a few miscellaneous Nuxt questions.

For Vue developers looking to create websites more efficiently, Nuxt.js is a game-changer. Tune in to discover why Nuxt could be the right framework for your next project.
