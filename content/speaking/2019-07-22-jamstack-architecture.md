JAMStack is interesting, though we will neither talk about the portable guitar amp, nor the stacking of jam.
Instead, we will explore a new modern approach to develop web applications based on Javascript, APIs and Markup. It promises improved security out of the box, easier scaling and also better performance while the cost will decrease.
This talk will highlight which promises the new web app architecture can resolve (pun intended)
