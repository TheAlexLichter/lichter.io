Meta-frameworks have developed rapidly in recent years - and so did Nuxt with its latest major version Nuxt 3!

In this talk, we will take a closer look at the vue-based meta-framework and find out what the differences are to using plain Vue and also take a look how what makes Nuxt special compared to other meta-frameworks.

At first, we have a little bit of theory and then jump into some live coding!
Together we will develop a small application, take a look at Nitro (the server engine of Nuxt), integrate APIs, and eventually deploy the application to a hosting platform ðŸ¤¯

And the best: You can influence what we build ðŸ‘€
