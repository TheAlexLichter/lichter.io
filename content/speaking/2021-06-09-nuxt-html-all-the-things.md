I had the pleasure joining Matt and Mike from HTML All The Things for an episode of their podcast. We discussed Vue.js, Nuxt.js and also talked about maintaining an open source project.

After introducing myself, we went straight into the tricky questions, like why one would use Nuxt instead of plain Vue. Then, we jumped over to [SSR](/topics/ssr) vs. Static Site Generation and when to use Nuxt at all.
We then talked about which "parts" of Nuxt I maintain and what the future brings for the meta framework.

Then, we shifted more to the general topic of open source and how to get started with it, as well as how it is to be a maintainer of a big open source project. From discussing the day-to-day duties, to talking about monetary compensations eventually discussing the difference of open-source vs. closed-source contributions.
