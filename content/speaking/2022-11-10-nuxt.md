Nuxt 3 is coming closer and closer to the final release. In this talk, we will take a look at the Vue-based meta-framework and the benefits it can provide to us developers. Besides building a tiny application, we will also check out Nitro, the new server engine of Nuxt, and eventually deploy our small app within minutes. The best thing? There is no extra knowledge needed besides the basics of Vue and the Composition API.
