PHP - Many people don't think about something positive when reading these three letters.
But how can it be that many people are averse to this server-side language?
And why is PHP's market share at an incredible 81 percent despite all the reluctance?

Under the headline "PHP is dead - Long live PHP" and in a cheerful mood we get to the bottom of all this.
Together with the long-time PHP developer Alexander Lichter we will find out how important PHP will be in 2017, if you can program excellent applications with it and what the future looks like for PHP!
Whether you are a PHP-hater or a new programmer, there is something for everyone in this talk. And the more people there are, the more fun it gets.
