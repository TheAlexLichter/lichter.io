Trice is nice! After my [first appearance in 2020](/speaking/2020-02-25-whats-your-vue-on-nuxt-webrush/) and the second one [merely a month ago](/speaking/2023-08-24-wuts-nuxt-for-nuxtjs-webrush) (at the time of writing), I had a blast joining the Web Rush crew again.

In the 250th episode of the podcast, the big topic was "Lessons from Building with Vue 3". As I built dozens of different apps with Vue and Nuxt over the last years, I was happy to share my opinions, experiences, and learnings. These also came from [client projects](/consulting/) which I've migrated over from Vue 2 to Vue 3.

We also got into the difference between the Options API and the Composition API(/topics/composition-api/), which I summaraized. Then we jumped into Dependency Injection and how it became a more common pattern in Vue 3 with the `provide`/`inject` functions.

Last but not least, I was happy to explain the different between `reactive` and `ref`, eventually sharing my own opinion on when to use which (hint: default to `ref`).

Oh, and I mentioned [Vue Vine](https://vue-vine.netlify.app/) and shared my opinion.
