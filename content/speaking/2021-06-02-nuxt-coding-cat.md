During my first appearance on the CodingCat.dev podcast, we talked about Nuxt 2 and a bit of personal backstory, as well as about business and MDX and MDC in Vue.

Starting with how I became a Nuxt contributor and team member, we then moved over to the business side and talked about how I founded my company. Eventually we pivoted back to more developer-centric topics and foucsed on what a component is in Vue and Nuxt, including the Single-File-Component pattern.

Then, Nuxt modules and their use cases were discussed, as well as the difference between Nuxt modules and Vue plugins. Nuxt Content, one of the official Nuxt modules, was also a topic, leading us to the question if there is something like MDX for Vue and Nuxt.
