During this podcast episode I had the chance to introduce Nuxt.js to the panel, explaining how to use it and what use cases it can be used for. This includes the various rendering modes like Server Side Rendering or Static Site Generation.

In addition, I explained why a developer should learn Nuxt.js and advises on a few learning resources. Then, I shared what’s next for Nuxt.js and what to expect in the newest version.

As a core team member at age 21, I also shared how I actually got involved with the Nuxt.js team, ending with a few stories about my own life and what is “nuxt” for me.
